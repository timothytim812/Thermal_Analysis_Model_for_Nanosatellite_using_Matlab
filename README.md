This code simulates the temperature variations of a nano satellite over three orbital periods, considering factors like solar radiation, albedo radiation, planetary radiation, and power dissipation. 

It calculates the satellite's thermal time constant, equilibrium temperatures during sun exposure and eclipse, and uses these to model temperature changes over time. 
The code also includes a plot to visually represent these temperature cycles, highlighting eclipse periods. 
This code can be used as a crucial tool for understanding and predicting thermal conditions a satellite experiences in orbit, essential for its design and operational planning.
